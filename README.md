# BIMM143_Project_3E
Project designed to answer: Is the mosquito species Anopheles gambiae genetically more similar to Anopheles darlingi than it is to Anopheles arabiensis due to similarities in climate even though the primary region in which An. gambiae is found is geographically closer to that in which An. arabiensis is primarily found?
